# WordleHelper
A python script for finding Wordle guesses

**Spoiler Alert:** This repository includes files that show previously used Wordle answers and the dates they were used.

## What is it?
My introduction to Python approximately coincided with my start to solcing the daily Wordle puzzle from the New York TImes.
So, naturally, I decided to use Python to help me refine my guesses based on the publicly available Wordle valid words list
and all the previously used Wordle answers.

## How does it work?
I mostly use this Python code via the Pythonista app on my iPhone. This allows me to take advantage of it wherever I am as
long as I have an internet connection.

After my first or second guess at the daily Wordle puzzle I can use the match_unused_words() function to find likely words
to guess.

## Future Work?
At present, I've been happy to use this code through Pythonista or the Python Console. I currently do have to manually 
update the used words files. So, I may revisit this project in the future to make it a web-based app that can also
manage the word lists.
